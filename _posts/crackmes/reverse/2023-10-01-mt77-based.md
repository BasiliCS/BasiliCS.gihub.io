In this [crackme](https://crackmes.one/crackme/64fdf93bd931496abf90994b) brought to us by [mt77](https://crackmes.one/user/mt77) we are tasked with reversing a Linux binary for `x86-64`.

## An interesting note on divisions in `x86`

When analyzing the x86 instructions, we ran into interesting assembly code:

```s
# Division by 4
shr     rax, 2

# Somehow division by 25
mov     rdx, 2951479051793528259
mul     rdx
mov     rax, rdx
shr     rax, 2
```
We are able to perform a division by a literal using a `mul` instruction.

### How `mul` works

`mul` is quite an unexpectedly complex instruction. At a glance it multiplies a register with `rax` and stores the result in `rax`.

However, to handle overflow `mul` can write to `rdx`. The least significant bytes of the multiplication are written to `rax` while the most significant bytes are written to `rdx`.

### Finding the magic number

Let $q, r$ be the quotient and reminder of $2^{66}$ by $25$.

We noticed that $2951479051793528259 = q + 1$.

Let's now prove that these operations give us a division.

Let $x < q - 1$, we can take the quotient $q_x$ and reminder $r_x$ of $x$ by $25$.

$$
\begin{align*}
x \times 2951479051793528259 &= 25 \times x_q * 2951479051793528259 + x_r \times 2951479051793528259 \\
&= x_q \times (25 \times (q + 1)) + x_r \times (q + 1) \\
&= x_q \times 2^{66} + x_q \times (25 - r) + x_r \times (q + 1)
\end{align*}
$$

- $x_q \times (25 - r) < x_q$ by definition of the reminder
- $x_r \times (q + 1) \le 2^{66} - (q + 1) + x_r$ by definition of the reminder

We can write $R = x_q \times (25 - r) + x_r \times (q + 1) \le 2^{66} + x - q - 1 < 2^{66}$

$$
x \times 2951479051793528259 = x_q \times 2^{66} + R \implies \lfloor x \times 2951479051793528259 / 2^{66} \rfloor = x_q
$$

We are able to retrieve the quotient we wanted!

## The code

Let's solve this challenge. Using IDA Free we were able to disassemble then decompile the binary. We studied the `luna` function:

```c
_BOOL8 __fastcall luna(unsigned __int64 a1)
{
  int v2; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-10h]
  int v3; // [rsp+1Ch] [rbp-Ch]

  v3 = 0;
  while ( a1 )
  {
    v2 = 2 * (a1 / 0xA % 0xA);
    if ( v2 > 9 )
      v2 -= 9;
    v3 += v2 + a1 % 0xA;
    a1 /= 100uLL;
  }
  return v3 % 10 == 0;
}
```

We need to try to find an integer that satisfies this property.

The digits are selected 2 by 2 and added together. In `v2` we take twice the first digit of the two and multiply it by 2. Later we add this result with the second digit.

The digit pair `11` adds 3 to `v3`, so `1111` brings us up to 6. We can add `12` to reach 10.

## Solution

`111112`
