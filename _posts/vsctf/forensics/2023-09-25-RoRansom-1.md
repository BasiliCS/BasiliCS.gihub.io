This forensics challenge was the first one of a series of 3 challenges related to Roblox in this CTF.

<!--more-->

We were given the same 2 AD1 files as evidences for the 4 forensics challs. It is a pretty uncommon file type, let's use FTK Imager on Windows.

## Investigation

After extracting all the files using FTK Imager, we have access to 3 main Windows Folders : `Programs`, `Users` and `Riot Games`.

After searching a bit, we notice that the files related to the Roblox game are stored in `\Users\ftcsvisgreat\AppData\Local\Roblox`


## Finding the game
We have to find the game joined by the victim.

After doing some research, we learn that the id of the game is caracterized by the name `placeid` in the logs.

By searching for this name in all the files, we find 5 different placeid values 

```734159876 | 292439477 | 14853367450 | 370731277 | 142823291```

We can get information about each game with the placeid by visiting the link `roblox.com/games/<placeid>`

The only suspicious game is the one with the placeid `14853367450` related to a game called `ftcsvthrowaway's Place`


## Inside the game
